# Web-Scraping-NYG

- This repository contains a web scraping project I completed on the New York Giants.
- My scraper was blocked by the website so I was only able to scrape data over 7 years (2021-2015)
- The actual analysis would have been able to pull more intersting results if the giants record had more deviation than it does over this time period
